# About this App
This is a simple app that displays information and images from the NASA Planetary API. This app was created for fun.

# Count Down
The app provides the feature of a countdown. This countDown() function will calculate the days left before a particular event takes place.

# Previous Entries
Previous entries are available to the user after clicking the Show Saved Entries button. These saved entries are created by retrieving the data posted on the local server through a get request. This data is then used to create HTML elements.

# Updating the UI
All the data used to update the UI are retrieved from the local server. The handleSubmit() function will connect all the moving parts together.
